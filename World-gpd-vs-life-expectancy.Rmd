The app has been developed using Shiny application from RStudio. The source code of the application can be found here.

The applicaton allows the users to:

- Plot the data in a scatter plot (GDP vs. Life Expectancy)
- Create a set of parameters, such as year and continent, for data visualization.
- Customize data visualization.
- Generate a table for the data
- Download the data

## Application Interface
The web app contains two sections: configuration and visualization part.

- **Configuration**: allows the users to filter the data and configure visualization of the data.
- **Visualization**: allows the users to see the (filtered) data being visualized in the form of graph/plot and table.
